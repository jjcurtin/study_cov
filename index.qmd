# Introduction
This is how you cite a paper using the bibtex key in Zotero [@simmonsFalsepositivePsychologyUndisclosed2011].

# Method

  There are seven methods for selecting covariates to include in linear models that we evaluated. The methods can best be broken down into two categories: those that do not involve systematically selecting covariates and those that do. For the former category, we explored inlcuding (1) no covariates in the linear models and including (2) all available covariates. Here, we consider all available covariates to mean all covariates that were measured prior to manipulation. For the latter category, we employed the method of (3) p-hacking to replicate that this is not a statistically valid method to use for covariate selection. 

  We manipulated the following variables as shown in [@tbl-dictionary] to create research settings that may be common in Psychology. We crossed all levels of each variable to create 540 unique research settings. For each unique research setting, we ran 40,000 simulations using the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC) at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Within each simulation, we generated a dataset, fit a linear model according to each of the seven aforementioned methods, and extracted the results from these models.
